                <p class="project__text__description_further">With the ‚Äúhow might we‚Äù in focus, a MSCW-prioritation was made together with the ECU-students and their market researches.</p>
                <img class="staysync_mscw" src="assets/images/staysync_mscw.png" alt="mscw">
                <p class="project__text__description_further">With the priorities straight, we (the design team) created lo-fi (or mid-fi since they are digital) prototypes that we presented to the ECU-students and they were content with our ideas!</p>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">Some of the first prototypes can be seen below:</p>

                </div>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">The focus points/words were <i>preferences</i>, <i>community</i> and <i>on-the-go</i>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="creating-an-identity">
                <h3>Creating an identity</h3>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">I took the lead to create the first graphic profile for this project and set the identity for this application.</p>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">First, a few keywords were set up, <i>schedule</i>, <i>synchronize</i>, <i>professional</i>, <i>housing</i>, and <i>FIFO-workers</i>. Out of all these I chose to continue with <i>schedule</i> and <i>synchronize</i> for the logo.</p>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">Since we already had the name Staysync from our previous sessions with ECU, the creation of the logotype worked out quite like this:</p>
                <img class="staysync_logo_creation" src="assets/images/staysync_logo_creation.png" alt="staysync logo creation process">
                <p class="project__text__description_further">For the color palette, we wanted to use something modern and clean. Taking inspiration from other professional apps, such as bank-apps, we chose the trendy kind of blurple color and followed up with neutral colors to adapt to the 60-30-10 rule.</p>
                <img class="staysync_color_palette_small" src="assets/images/staysync_color_palette_small.png" alt="staysync color palette">
                <p class="project__text__description_further">The logo and the color palette was then paired with a modern, readable font that allows some playfullness without disrupting that design-professional balance. Putting all of that together made our graphic profile which isn't very exstensive due to the time frames to work with, but it was nonetheless helpful to go back to when designing.</p>

            <div class="Development">
                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">The development was a smaller portion of this course and project - and even more so for my group which was most design focused. Even though I put most time into designing I also took the heavy load of the development since I was the most experienced within React which we were supposed to use for developing.</p>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">To fit the development into the time frame the parts to be developed were discussed with our teacher and only a selected number of things were coded. Those things were <i>rental ads feed</i>, <i>rental ads pages (when clicking in on an ad)</i>, <i>filter and search</i>, <i>profile</i>, <i>navigation</i>, and <i>login</i>. In this I had the responsibility for and developed the <i>feed</i>, <i>rendal ads page</i>, <i>filter and search</i>, <i>database connection and design for login</i> and outside of our list I had the main responsibility for the backed for which we used Firebase.</p>
                <h4 class="in_text_heading">React Native Expo</h4>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">The development was done using React Native through Expo connected to a github repository for easy version control and navigation.</p>
                <h4 class="in_text_heading">Backend</h4>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">The backend was handled using Firebase through authentication and firestore. The Firebase Authentication handled the email-login (which in reality would have been Australias version of Bank-ID) and Firestore was used to manually add ads and their info (since admin side where ads are posted was not a part of this project). The firestore collection was then read into a flatlist in the react project for the feed.</p>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">The filtering and search was done looking for matching words or boolean values towards firebase. In the ad-page, ID was used to fetch and display more information which also used image mapping for icon display.</p>
                <h4 class="in_text_heading">Demo</h4>
                <p class="project__text__description_further">Below is a short video demo of the application and the parts that were finished.</p>

The prototype for Staysync was given the price Best Prototype by representatives from ECU and I was rewarded with this certificate.

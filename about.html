                    Hello! My name is Jenny Tiger and I am a 4th year student pursuing a Master's degree in Interaction Technology and Design at Umeå University. 
                    <br><br>
                    Through my education I have become adept in many programming languages and techniques such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Python. Other skills and experiences I have gathered throughout the years are React, ASP.NET, SQL and WordPress. I also very familiar with some mathematical and statistical programs such as Rstudio and MatLab.
                    <br><br>
                    Even if I have many different development experiences, I will always love and be most fond of the design process and front-end development - including every step from Discover to Design. I am well adept in multiple design tools such as Figma and Photoshop. Design thinking? Yeah we learn that too in my education!
                    <br><br>
                    I am a problem solver at heart and have always enjoyed the journey from a problem or idea to a finished product or solution. I like every step of the way and if there is a way to connect with a costumer, I’m up for it.                </p>

                <p class="about_me__text"> 
                    Honestly, I ended up in this field by chance. The reason why I stayed and have continued to pursue this degree is because it's a perfect match for me. I love everything that has to do with design and figuration - anything creative really.
                </p>

                <p class="about_me__text"> 
                    During my time after graduating gymnasium (upper secondary school) I learnt a lot by just figuring out who I am and what I like to do. I worked full-time in costumer support, further developing my understanding for people and individuals diverse perceptions and needs. Today I can use my creative side together with the experiences from my rogue year to build and design solutions that are made for people. I am now on a journey of learning more skills within this field and I hope to keep learning far into my working life.

                <p class="about_me__text"> 
                    If I'm not designing, cursing over merge conflicts or taking a new course at uni, then you'll find me in the gym, in the kitchen cooking or baking, or going on an adventure with by boyfriend and dog.
